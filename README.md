# Myfirstmicrogame
A first person shooter game with obstacles that the player must get through in order to finish off the level. Once the game is opened, you being the player is welcomed with a robot which is meant to chase you unless you target it and destroy it. there are 2 in chich you are meant to kill. if you kill the robots, you gain more life. If you aren't able to get rid of them both you lose, but if you win you move to the path with the triangle on the top. There you are to get rid of an even bigger robot. If you are able to get rid of the bigger bot, u gain more health. In this project, I learnt where the different components are located, and also learnt how to add different characters to make the game engaging for players. I did face slight challenges but it was mainly trying to find what the tutorials said to find, which did take time but I was able to get through with it. That is techincally the only "issue" i came across because everything was easy to do.
